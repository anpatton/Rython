# WIP

## Rython
 
The goal here is to have a repository that shows exact input -> output translations for common R and Python operations so you (also me) can partially stop googling "how to do ___ in R/python SO". Things covered here will focus on data transformations or tricks I've picked up from googling/random chance/twitter/asking strangers. Not going to be a tutorial on how to build/do complex things of length. R code will be presented in a .md and python in a .ipynb -- both with have exactly the same item names/numbers for easy lookups. Requests accepted. As always, my R code is probably slightly 'better' than my python.

**If I asked for help and was given an answer, I will provide the person's name out of courtesy. This does not mean they invented the idea.** Also, don't be afraid to ask people for help no matter how good at something you think you are.

There is literally no order to how things occur beyond the first one where I load iris since that's going to be the example data whenever possible.

## Table of Contents

### 0) Load iris as dataframe
### 1) Split data into train/test sets
### 2) Split a dataframe into parts based on levels of a categorical variable
